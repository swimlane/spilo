# TLSH allows comparison with or without length considerations
#

test.sh			 # standard, consider length
test.sh -xlen 		 # ignore length

destroy_refresh_exp.sh	  	  # standard, consider length
destroy_refresh_exp.sh -xlen	  # ignore length


# Comprehensive testing procedure
#

* Edit the root CMakeLists.txt for each combination of TLSH_BUCKETS_128 and 
  TLSH_CHEKSUM_1B
* Make TLSH
* Run test.sh and test.sh -xlen


# Populate the expected results after the algorithm is changed
#

* Edit the root CMakeLists.txt for each combination of TLSH_BUCKETS_128 and 
  TLSH_CHEKSUM_1B
* Make TLSH
* Run destroy_refresh_exp.sh and destroy_refresh_exp.sh -xlen
